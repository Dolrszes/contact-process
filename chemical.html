  <h3>1. Production of sulfur dioxide (SO₂)</h3>
  <p>
    The first stage of the Contact Process involves the production of sulfur dioxide.
    This is achieved by burning sulfur in excess air or by roasting metal sulfide ores,
    such as zinc sulfide. In modern industrial plants, elemental sulfur is most commonly
    used because it produces fewer impurities.
  </p>

  <p>
    The reaction is highly exothermic and occurs at high temperatures, releasing a large
    amount of energy. The heat produced is often recovered and reused elsewhere in the
    process, improving overall energy efficiency.
  </p>

  <div class="equation">
    S (s) + O₂ (g) → SO₂ (g)
  </div>

  <p>
    The sulfur dioxide produced must be purified and dried before entering the next stage,
    as impurities such as dust or water vapour can poison the catalyst used later in the
    process.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide (SO₃)</h3>
  <p>
    In the second stage, sulfur dioxide is oxidised to sulfur trioxide in a reversible
    reaction. This step is crucial, as sulfur trioxide is the intermediate required for
    sulfuric acid production.
  </p>

  <p>
    The reaction is carried out at approximately 450 °C and near atmospheric pressure.
    Although lower temperatures favour a higher equilibrium yield of SO₃, they result in
    a slower reaction rate. Therefore, a compromise temperature is chosen to maximise both
    efficiency and yield.
  </p>

  <p>
    A vanadium(V) oxide (V₂O₅) catalyst is used to increase the reaction rate without being
    consumed. The catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation
    energy.
  </p>

  <div class="equation">
    2 SO₂ (g) + O₂ (g) ⇌ 2 SO₃ (g)
  </div>

  <p>
    According to Le Chatelier’s principle, the position of equilibrium can be influenced
    by temperature and pressure. Because the reaction is exothermic, lower temperatures
    favour the formation of sulfur trioxide.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Absorption and formation of sulfuric acid</h3>
  <p>
    Sulfur trioxide cannot be absorbed directly into water, as this reaction is extremely
    exothermic and produces a fine mist of sulfuric acid, which is difficult to condense
    and poses safety risks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead, sulfur trioxide is absorbed into concentrated sulfuric acid to form oleum
    (fuming sulfuric acid). This allows the reaction to be controlled safely and efficiently.
  </p>

  <div class="equation">
    SO₃ (g) + H₂SO₄ (l) → H₂S₂O₇ (l)
  </div>

  <p>
    The oleum formed is then carefully diluted with water to produce sulfuric acid of the
    desired concentration.
  </p>

  <div class="equation">
    H₂S₂O₇ (l) + H₂O (l) → 2 H₂SO₄ (l)
  </div>

  <p>
    This final step completes the Contact Process, producing sulfuric acid that is suitable
    for industrial use. Careful control of temperature, concentration, and flow rates is
    essential throughout the process to ensure safety, efficiency, and high product quality.
