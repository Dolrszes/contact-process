    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        The industrial process chosen for this project is the production of sulfuric acid using
        the Contact Process. Sulfuric acid was first produced on an industrial scale in the
        eighteenth century, while the modern Contact Process was developed in the late
        nineteenth century to improve efficiency and safety.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is one of the most important industrial chemicals worldwide.
        It is widely used in the production of fertilizers, detergents, dyes, explosives, and
        petroleum refining. A large proportion of sulfuric acid is used to manufacture
        phosphate fertilizers, which are essential for modern agriculture and global food
        security.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Contact Process demonstrates how scientific knowledge is applied to solve
        real-world industrial problems. By applying principles of chemical kinetics,
        equilibrium, and catalysis, sulfur dioxide can be efficiently converted into sulfuric
        acid on a large scale.
