    <p>
      The Contact Process remains the most effective method for the industrial production
      of sulfuric acid due to its high efficiency, use of catalysis, and ability to operate
      continuously on a large scale. Sulfuric acid is essential for fertiliser production,
      chemical manufacturing, and petroleum refining, making the process economically
      important worldwide.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the Contact Process offers economic and environmental advantages, it still
      requires careful control to minimise emissions and environmental risks. High conversion
      efficiency, catalyst reuse, and heat recovery systems reduce waste, but failures can
      result in pollution if not properly managed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Future developments are likely to focus on improving catalyst efficiency, reducing
      energy consumption, and increasing sustainability. Overall, the Contact Process
      demonstrates how scientific principles are applied to balance economic benefits with
      environmental responsibility in modern industry.
