    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        The Contact Process is expected to remain the primary method for industrial sulfuric
        acid production due to its efficiency, reliability, and economic importance. Sulfuric
        acid will continue to be essential for fertilizer production and other key industries.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ongoing research focuses on improving catalyst performance and reducing energy
        consumption by operating at lower temperatures. Stricter environmental regulations
        are also driving the development of safer technologies and improved gas purification
        systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the future, increased use of sulfur dioxide recovered from industrial waste streams
        may further reduce emissions and support more sustainable industrial practices.
        Overall, the Contact Process will continue to evolve as scientific advancements are
        applied to minimise environmental impact while maintaining economic value.
