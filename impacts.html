    <h2>Impacts of the Process</h2>

    <h3>Economic factor</h3>

    <h4>Advantages</h4>
    <p>
        One major economic advantage of the Contact Process is its high efficiency and ability
        to operate continuously on a large industrial scale. This significantly reduces the
        cost per unit of sulfuric acid and ensures a stable supply for industries such as
        fertilizer production and petroleum refining.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another economic advantage is the low cost of raw materials. Sulfur dioxide is often
        obtained as a by-product from other industrial processes, which reduces waste and
        lowers overall production costs.
    </p>

    <h4>Disadvantage</h4>
    <p>
        A significant economic disadvantage of the Contact Process is the high initial capital
        investment required. Specialized equipment and corrosion-resistant materials are
        necessary, increasing construction and maintenance costs.
    </p>

    <h3>Environmental factor</h3>

    <h4>Advantages</h4>
    <p>
        An important environmental advantage of the Contact Process is the reduction of sulfur
        dioxide emissions when the process is properly controlled. Sulfur dioxide, a major
        contributor to acid rain, is converted into sulfuric acid instead of being released
        into the atmosphere.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition, modern sulfuric acid plants recover heat generated during exothermic
        reactions. This improves energy efficiency and reduces the environmental footprint of
        the process.
    </p>

    <h4>Disadvantage</h4>
    <p>
        Despite these advantages, the Contact Process poses environmental risks if not
        carefully managed. Accidental releases of sulfur dioxide or sulfur trioxide can cause
        air pollution, while sulfuric acid spills may lead to long-term damage to ecosystems.
