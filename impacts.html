  <!-- ECONOMIC IMPACTS -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Economic impacts</h3>

    <p>
      The Contact Process has major economic importance because sulfuric acid is one of the
      most widely produced industrial chemicals in the world. Its production is often used
      as an indicator of a country’s level of industrial development.
    </p>

    <p>
      A key economic advantage of the process is its high efficiency. The use of a
      vanadium(V) oxide (V₂O₅) catalyst increases reaction rate while reducing energy
      consumption and operational costs. Operating at near atmospheric pressure also lowers
      equipment and maintenance expenses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sulfuric acid produced by the Contact Process is essential for the manufacture of
      phosphate fertilisers, which are critical for modern agriculture. As a result, the
      process indirectly supports global food production and economic stability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Heat released during the exothermic reactions can be recovered and reused to generate
      steam or electricity. This improves overall energy efficiency and makes large-scale
      production more economically sustainable.

  <!-- ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Environmental impacts</h3>

    <p>
      Despite its economic benefits, the Contact Process can have negative environmental
      impacts if not carefully controlled. The main concern is the release of sulfur
      dioxide (SO₂), a toxic gas that contributes to air pollution and acid rain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Acid rain can damage ecosystems, corrode buildings, and harm aquatic life by lowering
      the pH of lakes and rivers. Modern Contact Process plants therefore aim to minimise
      emissions by achieving high conversion efficiency and using advanced gas-cleaning
      systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another environmental issue is the high energy demand of the process. Although heat
      recovery systems reduce waste, the combustion of sulfur and fossil fuels contributes
      indirectly to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, sulfuric acid also plays an important role in environmental protection, such
      as wastewater treatment and the removal of impurities from industrial emissions.
      These applications partially offset the environmental impact of its production.

  <!-- SUSTAINABILITY -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Evaluation of sustainability</h3>

    <p>
      Compared to older methods such as the Lead Chamber Process, the Contact Process is
      considerably more sustainable. High conversion efficiency, catalyst reuse, and heat
      recovery significantly reduce waste and energy loss.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nevertheless, the process still relies on non-renewable resources and can cause
      environmental harm if emissions are not properly managed. Continuous technological
      improvements and strict environmental regulations are essential to reduce long-term
      environmental impact while maintaining economic benefits.

  <!-- ADVANTAGES / DISADVANTAGE -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Environmental factor</h3>
    <p class="badge">2 advantages · 1 disadvantage</p>

    <h4>Advantages</h4>
    <p>
      When properly controlled, the Contact Process significantly reduces sulfur dioxide
      emissions by converting SO₂ into sulfuric acid instead of releasing it into the
      atmosphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern plants recover heat from exothermic stages to improve energy efficiency,
      reducing the overall environmental footprint of sulfuric acid production.
    </p>

    <h4>Disadvantage</h4>
    <p>
      If equipment failure occurs, leaks of SO₂ or SO₃ may cause air pollution and
      acidification. In addition, sulfuric acid spills can lead to long-term environmental
      damage if not quickly contained.
