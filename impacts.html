  <div class="card">
    <h3>Economic factor</h3>
    <p class="badge">2 advantages · 1 disadvantage</p>

    <h4>Advantages</h4>
    <p>
     One major economic advantage of the Contact Process is its high efficiency.
  The use of a vanadium(V) oxide (V₂O₅) catalyst allows sulfur dioxide to be
  converted into sulfur trioxide at a fast rate, which reduces energy
  consumption and lowers operational costs. Operating at near atmospheric
  pressure also decreases the need for expensive high-pressure equipment,
  making large-scale production economically viable.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another economic advantage is the importance of sulfuric acid for key
  industries. Sulfuric acid produced by the Contact Process is essential for
  fertiliser manufacturing, petroleum refining, and chemical production.
  Its role in the production of phosphate fertilisers supports agricultural
  productivity and contributes to economic stability and food security on
  both national and global levels.
    </p>

    <h4>Disadvantage</h4>
    <p>
 A significant economic disadvantage of the Contact Process is the high
  initial capital investment required to build and operate production plants.
  Specialised equipment, catalysts, corrosion-resistant materials, and strict
  safety systems increase construction and maintenance costs, which can be a
  financial challenge, particularly for developing economies.
    </p>

  <!-- ===== Environmental factor ===== -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Environmental factor</h3>
    <p class="badge">2 advantages · 1 disadvantage</p>

    <h4>Advantages</h4>
    <p>
     An important environmental advantage of the Contact Process is the reduction
  of sulfur dioxide emissions when the process is properly controlled. Sulfur
  dioxide is a toxic gas that contributes to air pollution and acid rain, and
  converting it into sulfuric acid significantly reduces its release into the
  atmosphere.
    </p>

    <p>
     Another environmental advantage is improved energy efficiency. Modern
  Contact Process plants recover heat from exothermic reaction stages and reuse
  it within the system. This reduces fuel consumption and lowers greenhouse gas
  emissions associated with energy production.
    </p>

    <h4>Disadvantage</h4>
    <p>
Despite these advantages, the Contact Process can still cause environmental
  harm if not carefully managed. Equipment failure or leaks of sulfur dioxide or
  sulfur trioxide may lead to air pollution and acidification, while sulfuric
  acid spills can result in long-term environmental damage if not quickly
  contained.
