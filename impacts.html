  <h3>Economic impacts of the Contact Process</h3>
  <p>
    The Contact Process has significant economic importance because sulfuric acid is one
    of the most widely produced chemicals in the world. It is often described as an
    indicator of a country’s industrial strength, as large quantities are required for
    manufacturing, agriculture, and energy production.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the main economic advantages of the Contact Process is its high efficiency.
    The use of a vanadium(V) oxide catalyst allows sulfur dioxide to be converted to sulfur
    trioxide at a relatively fast rate, reducing energy consumption and operational costs.
    Additionally, the process operates at near atmospheric pressure, which lowers the cost
    of industrial equipment and maintenance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sulfuric acid produced by the Contact Process is essential for the manufacture of
    phosphate fertilisers. These fertilisers play a key role in increasing agricultural
    productivity and supporting global food supply. As a result, the Contact Process
    indirectly contributes to economic stability and food security in many countries.
  </p>

  <p>
    Heat released during the exothermic reactions can be recovered and reused to generate
    steam or electricity. This improves overall energy efficiency and further reduces
    production costs, making the process economically sustainable on a large scale.
  </p>

  <h3>Environmental impacts of the Contact Process</h3>
  <p>
    Despite its economic benefits, the Contact Process has several environmental impacts
    that must be carefully managed. One of the main concerns is the release of sulfur
    dioxide, a toxic gas that contributes to air pollution and acid rain if emitted into
    the atmosphere.
  </p>

  <p>
    Acid rain can damage ecosystems, corrode buildings, and harm aquatic life by lowering
    the pH of lakes and rivers. Modern Contact Process plants are therefore designed to
    minimise sulfur dioxide emissions through efficient conversion and the use of gas
    cleaning systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another environmental issue is the high energy demand of the process. Although energy
    recovery systems reduce waste, the burning of sulfur and fossil fuels used to generate
    heat can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, which are linked to climate change.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the other hand, sulfuric acid produced by the Contact Process is also used in
    environmental applications, such as wastewater treatment and the production of
    chemicals used to remove impurities from industrial emissions. This partially offsets
    the negative environmental impact of its manufacture.
  </p>

  <h3>Evaluation of sustainability</h3>
  <p>
    Overall, the Contact Process can be considered relatively sustainable compared to
    older methods, such as the Lead Chamber Process. High conversion efficiency, catalyst
    reuse, and heat recovery significantly reduce waste and energy loss.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, the process still relies on non-renewable resources and produces harmful
    emissions if not properly controlled. Continuous technological improvements and
    strict environmental regulations are therefore essential to minimise its long-term
    environmental impact while maintaining its economic benefits.

    <h3>Environmental factor</h3>
    <p class="badge">2 advantages + 1 disadvantage</p>

    <h4>Advantages</h4>
    <p>
      A major environmental advantage is the reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions when the process is properly
      controlled. SO₂, a contributor to acid rain, is converted into sulfuric acid instead of being released into
      the atmosphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern plants also recover heat from exothermic stages to improve energy efficiency, which reduces the overall
      environmental footprint of sulfuric acid production.
    </p>

    <h4>Disadvantage</h4>
    <p>
      The process can cause environmental harm if failures occur. Leaks of SO₂ or SO₃ may lead to air pollution and
      acidification, while sulfuric acid spills can result in long-term damage to ecosystems if not contained.
