    <h3>Economic factor</h3>
    <p class="badge">2 advantages + 1 disadvantage</p>

    <h4>Advantages</h4>
    <p>
      One major economic advantage of the Contact Process is its high efficiency and ability to operate
      continuously on a large industrial scale. This reduces the cost per unit of sulfuric acid and ensures
      a stable supply for industries such as fertilizer production and petroleum refining.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another advantage is the relatively low cost of raw materials. Sulfur dioxide is often obtained as a
      by-product from petroleum refining and metal extraction, reducing waste and lowering production costs.
    </p>

    <h4>Disadvantage</h4>
    <p>
      A key disadvantage is the high initial capital investment required. Corrosion-resistant materials and
      specialised equipment (converter, heat exchangers, absorption towers) increase construction and long-term
      maintenance costs.
    </p>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Environmental factor</h3>
    <p class="badge">2 advantages + 1 disadvantage</p>

    <h4>Advantages</h4>
    <p>
      A major environmental advantage is the reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions when the process is properly
      controlled. SO₂, a contributor to acid rain, is converted into sulfuric acid instead of being released into
      the atmosphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern plants also recover heat from exothermic stages to improve energy efficiency, which reduces the overall
      environmental footprint of sulfuric acid production.
    </p>

    <h4>Disadvantage</h4>
    <p>
      The process can cause environmental harm if failures occur. Leaks of SO₂ or SO₃ may lead to air pollution and
      acidification, while sulfuric acid spills can result in long-term damage to ecosystems if not contained.
