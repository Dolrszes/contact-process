    <h3>Economic factor</h3>
    <p class="badge">2 advantages · 1 disadvantage</p>

    <h4>Advantages</h4>
    <p>
      A major economic advantage of the Contact Process is its high efficiency.
      The use of a vanadium(V) oxide (V₂O₅) catalyst allows sulfur dioxide to be
      converted to sulfur trioxide at a fast rate, reducing energy consumption
      and lowering operational costs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sulfuric acid produced by the Contact Process is essential for industries
      such as fertiliser manufacturing, petroleum refining, and chemical
      production. This supports agricultural productivity and contributes to
      economic growth and food security on both national and global levels.
    </p>

    <h4>Disadvantage</h4>
    <p>
      A significant economic disadvantage is the high initial cost of setting up
      Contact Process plants. Advanced equipment, catalysts, and safety systems
      require large capital investment and continuous maintenance, which can be
      financially challenging, especially for developing economies.

  <!-- ===== Environmental factor ===== -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Environmental factor</h3>
    <p class="badge">2 advantages · 1 disadvantage</p>

    <h4>Advantages</h4>
    <p>
      When properly controlled, the Contact Process significantly reduces sulfur
      dioxide emissions by converting SO₂ into sulfuric acid instead of releasing
      it into the atmosphere. This helps to reduce air pollution and the formation
      of acid rain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern Contact Process plants recover heat from exothermic reaction stages
      to improve energy efficiency. This reduces fuel consumption and lowers the
      overall environmental footprint of sulfuric acid production.
    </p>

    <h4>Disadvantage</h4>
    <p>
      If equipment failure occurs, leaks of SO₂ or SO₃ may cause air pollution and
      acidification. In addition, sulfuric acid spills can result in long-term
      environmental damage if not quickly contained and properly managed.
